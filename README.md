# Web-page-MicaelaLopez
This work carried out for the foundations of computer engineering has been carried out with effort and dedication. 
It consists of a web page in Html and using a single CSS that redirects to different sites within it such as the topic, net, about me, contact, and degree that also leads to the fundamentals of computer engineering. It includes different images and links that take you to other external web pages.
During the work I have been able to realize the difficulties of carrying out this type of work, things as simple as for example just making a mistake in a letter can cause your link to not work. Using templates can help you work easier and faster, but if you use one that is a little more complicated it can lead to being more complex, as in my case, where I had to redo the work from the beginning. Also, I have had a problem with the images that have moved around.

Technically speaking I have come to the conclusion that HTML and CSS provide a great foundation for the development of web pages, they provide great ease in design and functionality.

This work has helped me develop the basic skills and knowledge that the teacher taught us in class, I have learned to rely on my classmates who have helped me when certain functionalities of the page did not do their job correctly.
